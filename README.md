# Deneb Visuals

This is a collection of advanced dataviz examples using [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/), [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), [Deneb](https://deneb-viz.github.io/) and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/).Â All the work is original and where this has been inspired by the work of others, I have pointed this out.
